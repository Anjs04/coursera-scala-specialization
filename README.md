## Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Instructor: **Martin Ordesky**
#### Topics
[Week 1](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week1) -
* Evaluation strategy and recursion: [fixedpoint.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week1/fixedpoint.sc) demonstrates writing a basic function in scala.
 [eval_strategy.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week1/eval_strategy.sc) illustrates call-by-name versus call-by-value (lazy evaluation).
```scala
def constOne(x: Int, y: => Int) = 1   //y has a type '=> Int' which means y is call-by-name
constOne(1+2, loop) //reduces to 1
constOne(loop, 1+2) //infinite cycle
```

[Week 2](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2) -
* higher order functions - basically functions that has functions as arguments. See [HOF.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2/HOF.sc) for some examples.
* Scala class and datastructure in scala example: [Rational.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2/Rational.scala), which gets called in [datastructure.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2/datastruct.sc)

[Week 3](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3) -
* class hierarchy and organization. See example: [List.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/List.scala) and [IntSet.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/IntSet.scala), which is called by [class_hierarchy.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/class_hierarchy.sc).
* Scala traits and abstract class. See [classes_org.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/classes_org.sc) for examples of extending traits as well as when you use Nothing and AnyVal.

[Week 4](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4) -
* Subtyping and typing rules for functions: see  [subtyping.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/subtyping.sc)
* polymorphism, illustrated in [MyList.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/MyList.scala) and the scala worksheet. [collectionlist.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/collectionlist.sc). As another example, [Boolean2.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Boolean2.scala) implements a boolean using an abstract class and two companion objects. In the object oriented approach with a trait and class implementations, we can make a singleton for things that only has one implementation. See the Scala implementation of the Peano number in [Nat.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Nat.scala).
* Pattern Matching, or a fancy if statements (a generalization of switch from C/Java to class hierarchies) is a good solution for Functional Decomposition. As the purpose of decomposition is to reverse the construction process, pattern matching offers a great way to automate this deconstruction process. The comparison of pattern matching decomposition approach (using scala trait and case class) with the object oriented approach (trait and class implementations) is highlighted in  [Expr.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Expr.scala), [Expr2.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Expr2.scala), and [Expr3.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Expr3.scala).
