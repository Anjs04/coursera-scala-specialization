## Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Instructor: **Martin Odersky**
#### Topics
[Week 1](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week1) -
* Evaluation strategy and recursion: [fixedpoint.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week1/fixedpoint.sc) demonstrates writing a basic function in scala.
 [eval_strategy.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week1/eval_strategy.sc) illustrates call-by-vale (imperative, C) versus call-by-name (lazy evaluation).

 ```scala
  def constOne(x: Int, y: => Int) = 1   //y has a type '=> Int' which means y is passed as a by-name parameter
  constOne(1+2, loop) //reduces to 1
  constOne(loop, 1+2) //infinite cycle
 ```

[Week 2](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2) -
* higher order functions - basically functions that has functions as arguments. See [HOF.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2/HOF.sc) for some examples.

  ```scala
   //without curry
   def fun(z: Int, x: Int): Int = z + x
   List(1,2,3) map (x => fun(5, x))          
   List(1,2,3) map (fun(5, _))               

   //with curry
   def fun2(z: Int)(x: Int): Int = z + x  
   List(1,2,3) map fun2(5)                
  ```
* Scala class and datastructure in scala example: [Rational.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2/Rational.scala), which gets called in [datastructure.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2/datastruct.sc)

[Week 3](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3) -
* class hierarchy and organization. See example: [List.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/List.scala) and [IntSet.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/IntSet.scala), which is called by [class_hierarchy.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/class_hierarchy.sc).
* Scala traits and abstract class. See [classes_org.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/classes_org.sc) for examples of extending traits as well as when you use Nothing and AnyVal.

[Week 4](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4) -
* Subtyping and typing rules for functions: see  [subtyping.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/subtyping.sc). Functions are contravariant in their argument types and covariant in their result type. For example, the scala Function1 trait:
 ```scala
 /* Variance
  * the '-' and '+' in front of the type A and R denotes the
  * variance. '+R' and '-A' means A <: R or 'A is a subtype of R' or * 'R is a supertype of A'
  */
 trait Function1[-A, +R] {
   def apply(x: A): R
 }
 ```
* polymorphism, illustrated in [MyList.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/MyList.scala) and the scala worksheet. [collectionlist.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/collectionlist.sc). As another example, [Boolean2.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Boolean2.scala) implements a boolean using an abstract class and two companion objects. In the object oriented approach with a trait and class implementations, we can make a singleton for things that only has one implementation. See the Scala implementation of the Peano number in [Nat.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Nat.scala).
* Pattern Matching, or a fancy if statements (a generalization of switch from C/Java to class hierarchies) is a good solution for Functional Decomposition. As the purpose of decomposition is to reverse the construction process, pattern matching offers a great way to automate this deconstruction process. The comparison of pattern matching decomposition approach (using scala trait and case class) with the object oriented approach (trait and class implementations) is highlighted in  [Expr.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Expr.scala), [Expr2.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Expr2.scala), and [Expr3.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Expr3.scala).

## Functional Program Design in Scala
Instructor: **Martin Odersky**

#### Topics
[Week 1](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/tree/master/coursera-program-design/src/week1) -
*  Partial functions
 ```scala
 val f1: PartialFunction[String, String] = { case "ping" => "pong" }

 //result: List(pong, 404, 404)
 List("ping", "abc", "pong").map(a =>
    if(f1.isDefinedAt(a)) f1(a) else "404"
 )
 ```
* For-expressions/for-comprehension - shortcuts for doing a flatMap, filter, then a map. Useful when you need to do nested loops.
* Random Generators and ScalaCheck
* Monad - functional programming and reactive programming pattern

3. Calculator - demonstrates timely effects
