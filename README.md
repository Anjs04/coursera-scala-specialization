## Functional Programming Principles in Scala
Instructor: **Martin Odersky**
* [Scala Cheatsheet](https://github.com/lampepfl/progfun-wiki/blob/gh-pages/CheatSheet.md)
* [Twitter Scala School](https://twitter.github.io/scala_school/collections.html)
* [Scala website](http://www.scala-lang.org/)
* Alternatively, [Functional Programming in Scala](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala) by Paul Chiusano and RÃºnar Bjarnason is a great alternative/complement to taking this course.
* Get practice with Scala by solving the [99 Scala problems](http://aperiodic.net/phil/scala/s-99/) and the problems of [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) and [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/).

#### Topics
[Week 1](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week1) -
* Evaluation strategy and recursion: [fixedpoint.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week1/fixedpoint.sc) demonstrates writing a basic function in scala.
 [eval_strategy.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week1/eval_strategy.sc) illustrates call-by-vale (imperative, C) versus call-by-name (not to be confused with lazy evaluation).

 ```scala
  def constOne(x: Int, y: => Int) = 1   //y has a type '=> Int' which means y is passed as a by-name parameter
  constOne(1+2, loop) //reduces to 1
  constOne(loop, 1+2) //infinite cycle
 ```

[Week 2](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2) -
* higher order functions - basically functions that has functions as arguments. See [HOF.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2/HOF.sc) for some examples.
* Currying and Partial applications - currying is the process of transforming a function that takes multiple arguments into a function that takes a single argument and returns another function that returns another function that takes remaining arguments. This way, we can transform any function of multiple arguments into chain of multiple functions with single argument (e.g., a partially applied function). Why would we want to break up a big complicated function that takes a dozen arguments into many smaller functions that take a few arguments each?

  ```scala
   // without curry
   def fun(z: Int, x: Int): Int = z + x  //fun is a function that takes two arguments
   List(1,2,3) map (x => fun(5, x))          
   List(1,2,3) map (fun(5, _))               

   // with curry
   def fun2(z: Int)(x: Int): Int = z + x  
   List(1,2,3) map fun2(5) //fun2(5), the argument of map, is a partially applied function of type Int => Int               
  ```

* Scala class and datastructure in scala example: [Rational.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2/Rational.scala), which gets called in [datastructure.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week2/datastruct.sc)

[Week 3](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3) -
* To run a Scala Application, just add a main function:

  ```scala
  object ScalaProgram {
    def main(args: Array[String]) = {
     println("hello world!")
    }
  }
  ```
* class hierarchy and organization. See example: [List.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/List.scala) and [IntSet.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/IntSet.scala), which is called by [class_hierarchy.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/class_hierarchy.sc).
```scala
 trait Tree[+T]
 case class Leaf[T](value: T) extends Tree[T]
 case class Branch[T](left: Tree[T], right: Tree[T]) extends Tree[T]
 case object Empty extends Tree[Nothing]
 object Tree { //companion object
   //functions in here can pattern match on case Leaf, case Branch, or case Empty.
 }
```
* Scala traits and abstract class. See [classes_org.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week3/classes_org.sc) for examples of extending traits as well as when you use Nothing and AnyVal.

[Week 4](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4) -
* Subtyping and typing rules for functions: see  [subtyping.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/subtyping.sc). Functions are contravariant in their argument types and covariant in their result type. For example, the scala Function1 trait:

 ```scala
 /* Variance
  * the '-' and '+' in front of the type A and R denotes the
  * variance. '+R' and '-A' means A <: R or 'A is a subtype of R' or * 'R is a supertype of A'
  */
 trait Function1[-A, +R] {
   def apply(x: A): R
 }
 ```
* polymorphism, illustrated in [MyList.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/MyList.scala) and the scala worksheet. [collectionlist.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/collectionlist.sc). As another example, [Boolean2.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Boolean2.scala) implements a boolean using an abstract class and two companion objects. In the object oriented approach with a trait and class implementations, we can make a singleton for things that only has one implementation. See the Scala implementation of the Peano number in [Nat.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Nat.scala).

* Pattern Matching, or a fancy if statements (a generalization of switch from C/Java to class hierarchies) is a good solution for Functional Decomposition. As the purpose of decomposition is to reverse the construction process, pattern matching offers a great way to automate this deconstruction process. The comparison of pattern matching decomposition approach (using scala trait and case class) with the object oriented approach (trait and class implementations) is highlighted in  [Expr.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Expr.scala), [Expr2.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Expr2.scala), and [Expr3.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week4/Expr3.scala).

[Week 5](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week5) -
* List operations - functions on list processing
* Pairs and Tuples - can help with program composition and decomposition. Pair is a 2-tuple. Pair can only take two things. Tuples can take as long of a sequence as you want.

 ```scala
 //pair
 val pair = ("answer", 42)

 //tuple
 //value assign using pattern matching - preferred because it's shorter and clearer
	val (label, value1, value2) = (pair._1, pair._2, 80) pair._1 //equivalent to label: "answer"
 	pair._2 //equivalent to value1: 42           
 ```

* Implicit Parameters and ```scala.math.Ordering```
* Higher Order List Functions (HOFs)
  * HOFs that take unary operators: filter, filterNot and Partition (combination filter and filterNot. takeWhile, dropWhile and span (combibnation takeWhile and dropWhile)
  * HOFs that take binary operators: reduce and fold

  ```scala
  //Scan is like recording the intermediate values of computing a fold
  //fold
  List("a","b","c").fold("!")((x,y) => x+y) //> res8: String = !abc
  List("a","b","c").scan("!")((x,y) => x+y) //> res9: List[String] = List(!, !a, !ab, !abc)

  //foldLeft - scans the original list and constructs the new list from left to right
  List("a","b","c").foldLeft("!")((x,y) => x+y)
                                                //> res10: String = !abc
  List("a","b","c").scanLeft("!")((x,y) => x+y)
                                                //> res11: List[String] = List(!, !a, !ab, !abc)
 List("a","b","c").foldLeft("!")((x,y) => y+x)   //> res12: String = cba!
 List("a","b","c").scanLeft("!")((x,y) => y+x)
                                                //> res13: List[String] = List(!, a!, ba!, cba!)
  //foldRight - scans the original list and constructs the new list from right to left
  List("a","b","c").foldRight("!")((x,y) => x+y)
                                                //> res14: String = abc!
  List("a","b","c").scanRight("!")((x,y) => y+x)
                                                //> res15: List[String] = List(!cba, !cb, !c, !)
 List("a","b","c").foldRight("!")((x,y) => y+x)  //> res16: String = !cba
 List("a","b","c").scanRight("!")((x,y) => y+x)
                                                //> res17: List[String] = List(!cba, !cb, !c, !)

  ```

* Natural induction and structural induction can be performed on functional programs because functional programming allows for referential transparency. Concat on list can be proved to be associative using structural induction. The fold-unfold method for equational proof of functional programs.

[Week 6](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-functional/src/week6) -

* Other Collections of Sequence. List, Vector, and Range are implementation of  Sequence, i.e., Sequence is a base class of List and Vector. Array and String are sequence like structures and "subclasses" of Sequence, but both came from the Java universe. Set and Map all have the base class Iterable.
  * List - O(N). Good for operations with access patterns that requires you to access head and tail sequentially. For Cons, you  use ```::```. For concat, you use ```++```. The fundamental operation for List is head and tail.
  * Vector - O(Log_32(N)). Good for bulk operations, such as map or a fold or filter (highly parallelizable operations). You can do it in chunks of 32. For Cons, you use ```+:``` to add element to the left of the Vector, or use ```:+``` to add element to the right of the Vector. Note that ```:``` always points to the sequence. For Vectors, the fundamental operation is index.

     ```scala
        0 +: nums //Vector(0, 1, 2, 3, -88)
        nums :+ 0 //Vector(1, 2, 3, -88, 0)

        def scalarProduct(xs: Vector[Double], ys: Vector[Double]): Double = {
		   (xs zip ys).map{case (x,y) => x*y }.sum
	     }
     ````    

 * String - a sequence from the java universe [java.lang.String](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/String.html)

     ```scala
    val s = "Hello World"
    s filter (c => c.isUpper) //HW
    s exists (c => c.isUpper)  //true
    s forall (c => c.isUpper)  //false
    s flatMap (c => List('.', c)) //.H.e.l.l.o. .W.o.r.l.d
     ```

 * Range

    ```scala
    val r: Range = 1 until 5 //Range(1, 2, 3, 4)
    val t: Range = 1 to 5 //Range(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    1 to 10 by 3 //Range(1, 4, 7, 10)
    6 to 1 by -2 //Range(6, 4, 2)

    def rangePairs(m: Int, n: Int) = {
		 (1 to m) flatMap (x => (1 to n) map (y => (x, y)))
	 }    
	 rangePairs(3,2) //Vector((1,1), (1,2), (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2))

    def isPrime(n: Int): Boolean = {
		(2 until n) forall (d => n % d != 0)
	 }
    ```

* Combinatorial Search and For-Expressions - for expressions handle nested sequences in combinatorial problems. Higher order functions on sequences often replaces loops. For nested loops, we can use for expressions. The general form is ```for ( s ) yield e ``` where s is a sequence of generators and filters, and e is an expression whose value is returned by an iterator. A generator is in the form ```p <- e``` instead of ( s ), braces { s } can also be used, and then the sequence of generators and filters can be written on multiple lines without requiring semicolons.

 ```scala
 def scalarProduct(xs: List[Double], ys: List[Double]): Double = {
   (for((x,y) <- xs zip ys) yield(x*y)).sum
 }
 ```

* Combinatorial Search examples - combine Sets and for expressions in a classical combinatorial search problem. Sets are unordered, do not have duplicate elements, and the fundamental operation for Set is contains. Checkout nqueens for an example of solution generation using Vector functions (```forall```, ```fill```, ```updated```), and for expressions.
* Map and Option

 ```scala
 val romanNumerals = Map('I' -> 1, 'V' -> 5, 'X' -> 10)
 val capitalOfCountry = Map("US" -> "Washington", "Switzerland" -> "Bern")
 capitalOfCountry("US")   //Washington
 capitalOfCountry("Andorra")  //NoSuchElementException
 capitalOfCountry get "Andorra"                  //> res1: Option[String] = None
 capitalOfCountry get "US"                       //> res2: Option[String] = Some(Washington)

 //With default function catches the exception and returns a default value
 val cap1 = capitalOfCountry withDefaultValue "<unknown>"
 cap1("Andorra")  //<unknown>

 //what withDefaultValue does behind the scene
 def showCapitalWithOption(country: String) = capitalOfCountry.get(country) match {
 		case Some(capital) => capital
 		case None => "missing data"
 	}
 	showCapitalWithOption("US")               //Washington
 	showCapitalWithOption("Andorra")          //missing data
 ```

 groupBy and orderBy operations in SQL queries have analogues in Scala, namely sortWith and sorted.

 ```scala
 val fruit = List("apple", "pear", "orange", "pineapple")
                                                //List(apple, pear, orange, pineapple)
 fruit sortWith (_.length < _.length)      //List(pear, apple, orange, pineapple)
 fruit sorted                              //List(apple, orange, pear, pineapple)

 //groupBy partitions a collection into a map of collections according to a discriminator function f
 fruit groupBy (_.head)  //Map(p -> List(pear, pineapple), a -> List(apple), o -> List(orange))
```

#### Topics
[Week 1](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/tree/master/coursera-program-design/src/week1) -
*  Partial functions - See [partialfuns.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week1/partialfuns.sc)

 ```scala
 val f1: PartialFunction[String, String] = { case "ping" => "pong" }

 //result: List(pong, 404, 404)
 List("ping", "abc", "pong").map(a =>
   if(f1.isDefinedAt(a)) f1(a) else "404"
 )
 ```
* For-expressions/for-comprehension - shortcuts for doing a flatMap, filter, then a map. Useful when you need to do nested loops. See [collections.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week1/collections.sc) for how to use for expressions to implement filter, map, and flatMap, and vice versa. See [json.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week1/json.sc) and [query.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week1/query.sc) for how for expressions are useful for database query and json applications. [Sets](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Set) are typically used for database query or keeping track of a set of explored in graph search applications because Sets don't contain duplicates.
* Random Generators and ScalaCheck - [Generator.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week1/Generators.scala) has various random generators written using ```scala.util.Random```. [generators.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week1/generators.sc) shows how it's used.
* Monad - functional programming and reactive programming pattern. Three Monad Laws, Option and Try. See [monad.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week1/monad.sc). Some good articles on monads: [Demystifying the Monad in Scala](https://medium.com/@sinisalouc/demystifying-the-monad-in-scala-cc716bb6f534#.ebd50ld0z) and [Functors and Applicative](https://medium.com/@sinisalouc/functors-and-applicatives-b9af535b1440#.lx20785nm)

[Week 2](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/tree/master/coursera-program-design/src/week2) -
* [Stream](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.Stream) - Streams are similar to [Lists](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.immutable.List), but their tail is evaluated only on demand. There are three ways to create Streams:

 ```scala
  //Notice the tail is a "?". This means the tail is not yet evaluated
  Stream(1,2,3) //res: Stream(1, ?)
  (1 to 3).toStream //res: Stream(1, ?)
  val xs = Stream.cons(2, Stream.cons(3, Stream.empty)) //res: Stream(2, ?)
  1 #:: xs //res: Stream(1, ?)
 ```

 Unlike the List, only the head of the Stream gets evaluated when it's first instantiated. The tail do not get evaluated until it's first needed.

 ```scala
 def streamRange(lo: Int, hi: Int): Stream[Int] = {
    print(lo+" ") //<- a side effect
    if(lo >= hi) Stream.empty
    else Stream.cons(lo, streamRange(lo + 1, hi))
 }

 /* The following will not print out "1" because the tail of the
  * stream is unevaluated so it will only print out the head (i.e. 1)
  */
 streamRange(1, 10).take(3)  

 /* The following will print out "1 2 3" as side effect because we
  * are forcing all the tails of the Stream to be evaluated by making * it toList
  */
 streamRange(1, 10).take(3).toList
 ```
 See [MyStream.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week2/MyStream.scala) for an implementation and [Stream.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week2/stream.sc) for some examples of using Stream.
* Lazy Evaluation - Laziness means do things as late as possible and never do them twice. The later is achieved with memoization, meaning storing the result of the first evaluation and re-using the stored result instead of recomputing. This optimization is sound, since in a purely functional language, an expression produces the same result each time it is evaluated. In the case of by-name and strict evaluation, everything is recomputed. In general, lazy evaluation is a combination of by-name evaluation and memoization. See [laziness.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week2/laziness.sc) for some examples of lazy evaluations and infinite sequence using Streams. [MyLazyStream.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week2/MyLazyStream.scala) modified [MyStream.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week2/MyStream.scala) to be lazy in the tail.

 ```scala
 //If you run the following program, "xzyz" gets printed as a side effect
 def expr = {
    val x = { print("x"); 1} //val gets instantiated when you first define it
    lazy val y = { print("y"); 2 } //lazy val gets instantiated only the first time you use it
    def z = { print("z"); 3 } //def gets instantiated everytime you use it
    z + y + x + z + y + x
 }    
 ```
* Infinite Sequence - using Streams

 ```scala
 // The Sieve of Eratosthenes:
 def sieve(s: Stream[Int]): Stream[Int] =
   s.head #:: sieve(s.tail filter (_ % s.head != 0))

 val primes = sieve(from(2))  //> primes  : Stream[Int] = Stream(2, ?)
 primes.take(10).toList    //> res4: List[Int] = List(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29)
 ```
* The water pouring problem - Program Design. Two optimizations to avoid re-computation: (1) keep a list of explored paths, pass that into the next Path calculation (2) pass the current endState to the constructor of the next Path so the next Path won't have to recompute the last Path's endState all over again using the history. See [Pouring.scala](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week2/Pouring.scala) and [pouringTest.sc](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-program-design/src/week2/pouringTest.sc) for implementation and result.

## Parallel Programming
Instructors: **Viktor Kuncak and Aleksander Prokopec**
* [Code from Lectures](https://github.com/axel22/parprog-snippets)

#### Topics
[Week 1](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-parallel/src/week1) -
* Deadlock
* Parallelism on the JVM
* First Class Tasks

[Week 2](https://github.com/xiaoyunyang/coursera-scala-specialization/blob/master/coursera-parallel/src/week2)
* Parallel map - implement using a Tree:


  ```scala
  def parMap[A: Manifest, B: Manifest](t: Tree[A], f: A => B): Tree[B] = t match {
    //match on shape of the tree
	 case Leaf(a) => {      
      //...A sequential map of array producing an array using a loop.
    }
	 case Node(l, r) => { //do parallel for the large cases, i.e., Node
	   val (lb, rb) = parallel(parMap(l, f), parMap(r, f))
		Node(lb, rb)
	 }
  }         
  ```

* Parallel fold and reduce - implement using a Tree.

  ```scala
  def parReduce[A](t: FoldTree[A], f: (A,A) => A): A = t match {
      case Leaf(v) => v
      case Node(l,r) => {
        val (lb, rb) = parallel(parReduce(l, f), parReduce(r,f))
        f(lb, rb)
      }
  }
  ```
  Associative property is important here.

* Parallel scan - requires upsweep and downsweep and a Tree consisting of a ```Leaf```, ```Node``` and a ```NodeRes```, which allows the Trees storing intermediate value in Node.

  ```scala
  sealed abstract class ScanTreeRes[A] {
  	val res: A
  }
  case class LeafRes[A](override val res: A) extends TreeRes[A]
  case class NodeRes[A](l: TreeRes[A], override val res: A, r: TreeRes[A]) extends TreeRes[A]
  case class Node[A](l: TreeRes[A],	override val res: A, r: TreeRes[A]) extends TreeRes[A]
  
  def upsweep[A](inp: Array[A], from: Int, to: Int, f: (A,A) => A): ScanTreeRes[A] = {
      if(to - from < threshold)
	     Leaf(from, to, reduceSeg(inp, from + 1, to, inp(from), f)) //imperative solution using loop
	   else {

#### Programming Assignments
1. Box Blur Filter - demonstrates Tasks
  * boxBlurKernel - this method computes the blurred RGBA value of a single pixel of the input image
  * HorizontalBoxBlur - singleton which implements methods blur and parBlur to blur horizontal pixels of the image in parallel
  * VerticalBoxBlur - singleton which implements methods blur and parBlur to blur vertical pixels of the image in parallel
  * To run the ScalaShop program, in the console:
    ```
      sbt
      > runMain scalashop.ScalaShop
    ```
2. Reductions and Prefix Sums - demonstrates basic task parallel algorithms
3. K-Means - demonstrates Data-Parallelism
4. Barnes-Hut Simulation - demonstrates data structures for Parallel Computing
